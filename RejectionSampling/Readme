 Rejection Sampling for approximate Bayesian Inference
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Rejection Sampling on Bayes Nets. 
 Two Bayes Nets with slightly differnet structures were taken and 
 Rejection Sampling was performed on the two nets to analyze the effects
 of varying the number of samples N and the error of approximation.

 In the folder scripts, there are three matlab files. 
 The master_Script files are the files which initialize the bayes nets, 
 conditional probabilities and invokes rejection sampling on the data. 
 It also plots the output graphs representing errors as a function of the 
 number of samples taken. The graphs obtained are given in the results folder. 
 
 The two master_script files represent two differnt varaitions to the simple 
 Bayes nets structure used here. The infernece required is mentioned in the files
 and the results are plotted. 
 
 The rejectionsampling file has the function which performs the rejections sampling
 on the  number of samples given by N, the evidence and the Conditional probability values.
 The Bayes net is also a paramter to the function and it represents the graph as a cell array, 
 with each index pointing to its parents.
